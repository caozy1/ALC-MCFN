Project Overview
With the digital transformation of archives, open archival intelligent auditing faces challenges in efficiently processing long-text content (e.g., meeting minutes, privacy profiles). Existing models often fail to fully capture deep semantic information or handle long-text redundancy.
ALC-MCFN addresses these issues by:
Removing redundant content while preserving semantic coherence via adaptive long-text cropping.
Fusing three key feature types (global, local, logical) to enhance text understanding.
Improving classification accuracy with a channel-adaptive enhancement module (MCA-CorNet).
The model is designed to support archival openness auditing, helping classify archives into "open" or "delayed-release" categories efficiently.
